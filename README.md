# Fetch_Douban_books_by_tags
A python script for downloading douban books metadata.

Additon:
With whole Qingming Festival day downloading, I finally used this script all the hot tags of books including more than 9GB json file.
Douban has a rate limit of 40 p/s, so I try to adjusting my sleep time also using random() avoiding its potential machine learning limit.
Finally it's worked well, with always downloading 5h continuously.

For it's too big to upload, if you need this piece of douban books metadata materials, you could send me a email and may be I could directly copy it using Hardisk Drive.
Enjoy it.
